# Module 15: leaflet-challenge

## This repository contains analysis from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) regarding earthquake data. Utilizing new tools from the USGS we are able to visualize the earthquake data. In particular, my code and visualizations will enable a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## The Main URL for the USGS Earthquake data is: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## The particular dataset I utilized to create my visualization covers earthquake data from the past 7 days which have a magnitude of 2.5 or larger. I choose to focus on a larger magnitude of earthquakes rather than choosing M1.0+ as the bigger the magnitude, usually the more damage and devastation. I have always found earthquake data very interesting as I was born and raised in Southern California so I grew up experiencing this natural phenomenon.
### Specfic URL for M2.5+ Earthquake data: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_week.geojson

## With this dataset, I imported and visualized the data by following: 
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude. Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


## The resulting map is shown below:
